**Paperless-AI** is an AI-powered extension for [Paperless-ngx](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx) created by [clusterzx](https://github.com/clusterzx) that brings automatic document classification, smart tagging, and semantic search using OpenAI-compatible APIs and Ollama.

## 🔧 About This Fork

This is a **community-maintained integration fork** that:
- 🧪 Tests and merges pending upstream pull requests
- 📦 Provides optimized Docker images (Lite & Full variants)
- 🔒 Applies security updates and dependency maintenance
- 🐛 Integrates community bug fixes
- 📝 Offers additional documentation

**Important:** This fork exists purely for experimentation and integration testing. All development credit belongs to the original author. Think of this as a "tinkering workshop" where community fixes are tested before potentially flowing back upstream.

**Want the official version?** → [clusterzx/paperless-ai](https://github.com/clusterzx/paperless-ai)

It enables **fully automated document workflows**, **contextual chat**, and **powerful customization** — all via an intuitive web interface.

> 💡 Just ask:  
> “When did I sign my rental agreement?”  
> “What was the amount of the last electricity bill?”  
> “Which documents mention my health insurance?”  

Powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, you can now search semantically across your full archive and get precise, natural language answers.
